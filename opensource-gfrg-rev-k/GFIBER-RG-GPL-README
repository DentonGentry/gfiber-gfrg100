HOW TO BUILD A FIRMWARE FOR THE Google Fiber Residential Gateway (RG)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

* How to install the Actiontec Google Fiber RG source code onto the 
  Linux workstation.
* How to build the Google Fiber RG firmware for Actiontec GFRG110 
  Rev-K board.

NOTE: The following procedures are known to work with recent versions of 
Fedora. Along with the Basic Fedora Install you will want to add the
Software Developement packages that are provided with Fedora. 

The Actiontec Google Fiber RG Source Code, i386-jungo-linux-gnu compiler, 
arm-fibertec-linux-gnueabi toolchain and jpkg package can be obtained from 
the Actiontec support website at http://opensource.actiontec.com.

1. Download Google Fiber RG source code, i386 GNU compiler, ARM toolchain
   and JPKG package.
   (4 files)
   Source code: actiontec-opensource-gfrg-rev-k-fw-X-Y-Z.tar.gz
   i386 GNU compiler: i386-jungo-linux-gnu.tar.gz
   ARM Toochain: toolchain-arm-fibertec-linux-gnueabi.jpkg
   JPKG package: jpkg.tar.gz
 
2. Copy or Move the source code to the HOME directory
   $ cp actiontec-opensource-gfrg-rev-k-fw-X-Y-Z.tar.gz $HOME

3. Change to the Home directory
   $ cd $HOME

4. Extract the contents of the source code
   $ tar -zxvf actiontec-opensource-gfrg-rev-k-fw-X-Y-Z.tar.gz

   IMPORTANT: Extracting the source code creates the directory 
   "opensource-gfrg-rev-k" and the subdirectory "rg". The bulk of the 
   source code resides in "rg". The Makefiles in the distribution 
   expects that Jungo's openrg GCC 3.3.2 based compiler will be located 
   at "/usr/local/openrg". Both the x86 (i386-jungo-linux-gnu) and 
   ARM (arm-fibertec-linux-gnueabi) compilers should be installed to the 
   "/usr/local/openrg" directory.

5. The following commands assume that the User is still in the Home directory.

6. Change to Super User for the following commands, requires the root password
   $ su - 
   PASSWORD:

7. Create the "openrg" directory at "/usr/local"
  # mkdir /usr/local/openrg

8. Move the compiler, toolchain and jpkg package to the "openrg" directory
  # mv i386-jungo-linux-gnu.tar.gz /usr/local/openrg
  # mv jpkg.tar.gz /usr/local/openrg
  # mv toolchain-arm-fibertec-linux-gnueabi.jpkg /usr/local/openrg

9. Change to the "openrg" directory
  # cd /usr/local/openrg

10. Extract the contents of the i386-jungo-linux-gnu compiler
  # tar -zxvf i386-jungo-linux-gnu.tar.gz 

11. Extract the contents of the jpkg package
  # tar -zxvf jpkg.tar.gz

12. Install and prepare the toolchain
  # ./jpkg -x -C / toolchain-arm-fibertec-linux-gnueabi.jpkg

13. Change to the original Home directory, the place-holder called <account>, 
  represents the name of the account you were using before you changed to Super 
  User, earlier in these directions. If your login is "bobby", then there will 
  be a directory within the Home directory named "bobby", and that is where you 
  will find the "/opensource-gfrg-rev-k/rg" directory. If so, the command 
  would look like this: "cd /home/bobby/opensource-gfrg-rev-k/rg".)
  # cd /home/<account>/opensource-gfrg-rev-k/rg

14. When you have changed to the "rg" directory, the following command will 
    build the Google Fiber RG source code.
  # make config DIST=FIBERTEC_FEROCEON CONFIG_RG_GPL=y LIC=../jpkg_fibertec.lic.gpl && make
