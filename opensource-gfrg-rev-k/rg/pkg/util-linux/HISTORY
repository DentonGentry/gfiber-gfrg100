util-linux 2.9:

HIGHLIGHTS for version 2.9:

1) Removed programs:
   - strings. There is a version in binutils.
   - frag. (Moved to historic in 2.4, crept back in 2.5. Gone again.)
1a) Not yet removed program:
   - setfdprm. It also is in fdutils-5.2 (with an exceptionally
     ugly man page).
1b) Removed directory:
   - bsd. (The routine getopt() is in libc. err() moved to lib.)
2) Improvements:
   - ddate has been fixed to count down to the new, right X-day
   - look is now willing to search non-English dictionaries
     (i.e., uses locale)
   - cal now knows that Dutch day abbreviations have length 2 only
   - mcookie does not block when no random stuff is available
   - shutdown got a configuration file /etc/shutdown.conf
   - fdisk now reads SGI disk labels (thanks to Andreas Neuper)
   - mkswap now knows about new swap areas; mkswap.8 has been rewritten
   - umount knows about umount2() and forced unmounting of nfs mounts
     (however, I don't think it really works)
   - mount is now willing to handle file names with embedded spaces
   - mount can now mount things by UUID or volume name
3) Uglifications:
   - swap.h has been replaced by a private swap_constants.h since
     <linux/swap.h> does not compile
   - reboot has become a private routine, since libc5 and glibc2 conflict
   - a mkminix-0.1 directory contains some patches to let mkfs.minix
     work under DOS. (Untested.)
4) Numerous other small changes.

0xF) Send questions and/or patches to util-linux@math.uio.no

util-linux 2.9 was released by Andries Brouwer - aeb@cwi.nl
The address util-linux@math.uio.no reaches Rik, Andries, Peter,
Michael, Erik, Nicolai and possibly others.  Hwclock stuff is
forwarded to Bryan.

util-linux 2.8:

HIGHLIGHTS for version 2.8:

1) New programs:
   - getopt(1) by Frodo Looijaard replaces the older bsd based version.
     Keywords: Backward compatible, supports --long options.
1) Removed programs: 
   - chroot: is no longer in util-linux.  Get it free with GNU sh-utils
   - hostid: No-one could figure out the right way for this program to
		work.  Another hostid program is included in poeigl
		(see the LSM, Primary-site: ftp.daimi.aau.dk /pub/linux/poe)
2) Various portability enhancements.  Among other things hwclock now works
   a lot better on non Intel architectures.  Should compile with libc 4, 5
   and 6 as well as old and recent kernels.  People using non-intel hardware
   are encouraged to send patches.
3) rev now only limits linelength to memory capacity
4) dmesg now uses a buffer that matches the kernel buffer in size (8KB)


util-linux 2.7:

HIGLIGHTS for version 2.7:

1) util-linux now _requires_ ncurses.  Several programs are completely
   converted to use terminfo (instead of termcap).

2) Removed progams:
   - clock: Dropped entirely.  Use hwclock (included).
   - sync: is in gnu fileutils.
   - setserial: Is being maintained by Ted Ts'o, he recommends
	setserial-2.12 (2.13 is bad luck)
   - clear: Included in ncurses
   - hostname, domainname, dnsdomainname: It's in net-utils.
   - lpcntl.

3) Bugfixes, additions:
   - cfdisk: A much improved version. All known bugs have been fixed.
   - sfdisk: A command line fdisk type utility, formerly called fdisk-3.04.
   - SECURITY: All known holes in login, chfn, chsh and others have been
     plugged.  UPGRADE NOW if you haven't already fixed them yourself.
   - Should work with libc 4, 5 and 6 (gnulibc), on m68k, intel, alpha
     and sparc.

4) Problems:
   - The rpcgen that comes in NetKit-B-0.09 is broken.  At least as
     packaged with RedHat 4.2 (NetKit-B-0.09-6).  There are several
     ways to deal with this:
     - Don't run rpcgen, the needed pre-generated sources are included
       (nfsmount_xdr.c).  You must hack mount/Makefile to do this.
     - Edit the source emitted by rpcgen so it can compile.  This is very
       simple if you know C.
     - Disable the NFS parts of mount.  You have to edit mount/Makefile
       to do this.
     - Use some other rpcgen.

util-linux 2.6.1

This release was never made public

See notes for 2.6 for installation instructions.

This is a incremental release containing some fixes.  A new release
will be made later fixing the outstanding bugs.
- Things compiles and works better with recent releases of kernel, 
  ncurses, and so forth: fdisk, more
- Some fixes to make things compile out of the box on alphas.
- There has been reported a problem with login and /etc/usertty.  It
  should be fixed.  If you still have problems get a recent MAKEDEV and 
  use it to make new tty devices.  They were renumbered sometime during
  the 1.3 phase of the kernel.
- ipcs now displays the key of the structures.
- A (harmless?) overflow bug was fixed in login.

Outstanding bugs:
- login/getty has a denial of service problem.
- Several places needs a bit more polish.
- There are a _lot_ of nonfatal warnings when compiling mount.  This will
  not necesarily be fixed.


util-linux 2.6

HIGHLIGHTS for version 2.6:

0) The first release with me at the helm.  PLEASE SEND PATCHES AND
   UPDATES TO: util-linux@math.uio.no.

1) Removed programs:
   - md5sum, dsplit: available in GNU textutils.
   - syslogd: Sysklogd is now prefered.  It is available at 
	tsx-11.mit.edu:/pub/sources/sbin
	sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/system/Daemons

2) Bugfixes, additions: 
   - SECURITY: All known holes in mount have been fixed.  UPGRADE NOW
     if you haven't already!
   - Portability enhancments to the minix filesystem utils (m68k and
     Arm patches).
   - passwd/chsh/chfn will not mess up the passwd file on a NIS machine
   - others too numerous to enumerate.

3) New programs: 
   - vigr (it's like vipw)
   - Introducing hwclock.  A complete rewrite of the latest available
     clock source.  It supports intel/CMOS, /dev/rtc and linux/m68k
     system clock interfaces.  Clock supports the same things but is now
     obsolete and will not be present in the next release.  Start using
     hwclock now.  Please.


util-linux 2.5

HIGHLIGHTS for version 2.5:
0) Nicolai Langfeldt is taking over maintenance of util-linux, with the
   help of a few others (Michael K. Johnson, Andries Brouwer, and Rik
   Faith).

   PLEASE SEND PATCHES AND UPDATES TO: util-linux@math.uio.no

1) The following packages have been removed.  Please use the up-to-date,
   canonical versions of these packages from the listed places:

    timezone support (/usr/lib/zoneinfo, libz.a, zic, zdump):
        elsie.nci.nih.gov:/pub/tzcode95d.tar.gz
        elsie.nci.nih.gov:/pub/tzdata95h.tar.gz
    MAKEDEV-C:
        sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/system/Admin/MAKEDEV-C-1.5.tar.gz
    MAKEDEV:
        sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/system/Admin/MAKEDEV-2.2.tar.gz
    md5sum:
        prep.ai.mit.edu:/pub/gnu/textutils-1.3.tar.gz
        [The GNU version is now compatible with the Plumb/Lankester
        version.]
    ksymoops:
        Now bundled with the kernel in linux/scripts.

2) update_state has been removed
3) fdisk now supports NetBSD disklabels courtesy of Bernhard Fastenrath
   <fasten@athene.informatik.uni-bonn.de> (and > 8GB disks, courtesy of
   Andries Brouwer)
4) mount improved -- many patches from Andries Brouwer for greatly improved
   error reporting
5) ddate, chkdupexe, and other programs have been improved and bug fixed
6) util-linux is now a source-only distribution
7) mcookie generates better random numbers and will use /dev/random or
   /dev/audio if available
8) chfn, chsh, passwd, and vipw have been updated with security patches
   from Zefram <A.Main@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>.  Now, they all use the same
   locking, and several security holes have been patched.  Further, chsh
   and chfn can be configured at compile time to require a password before
   updates and chsh can be configured to only use shells from /etc/shells.
        

HIGHLIGHTS for version 2.4 (2.3 was never released):
0) Michael K. Johnson <johnsonm@nigel.vnet.net> is the interim maintainer
   while Rik Faith is working on PhD work.
1) login now makes the login tty mode 600 and places it in group "tty"
2) wall, and write will not write dangerous escape sequences
3) wall and write can be run setgid "tty".  If util-linux is compiled for
   this option, "mesg y" will only set group write instead of group/other
   write.
4) fdisk and cfdisk have been patched with the latest llseek.c.  Although I
   had a lot of bug reports about fdisk from util-linux-2.2, I was unable
   to reproduce any of the problems.  Some of the problems appeared to be
   releated to a failure to reboot the machine after changing the partition
   table, and some may have been due to a specific kernel revision problem.
   However, this doesn't seem to account for all of the bug reports -- if
   this version gives you problem, please send as complete a bug report as
   possible.
5) chkdupexe from Nicolai Langfeldt (janl@ifi.uio.no)
6) ctrlaltdel now installs into /sbin instead of /usr/sbin
7) mkfs replacement from Ron Sommeling (sommel@sci.kun.nl)
8) lpcntl removed.  Use tunelp instead.
9) ksymoops from Greg McGary <gkm@magilla.cichlid.com>
10) mkfs.minix now clears the first 512 bytes of the file system so that
    Minix disks won't be confused with MSDOS disks (Daniel Quinlan
    (quinlan@yggdrasil.com))
11) mkswap should now work on an Alpha running Linux
12) frag removed.  See
    sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/system/Filesystems/defrag-0.6.tar.gz for the
    latest version.
13) mount patches from Andries.Brouwer@cwi.nl and Dan Quinlan
    (quinlan@yggdrasil.com).
14) MAKEDEV and MAKEDEV-C updated to the latest versions.
15) Paths updated for FSSTND 1.2.  This means that you may need to make
    some links.  The links you need to make we system dependent.  The
    ultimate goal is to rename /var/adm to /var/log and have a symbolic
    link from /var/adm to /var/log during the transition period.  If you
    are running an ELF system, you probably won't have to do anything.  The
    bottom line is that the following files must exist or be pointers to
    the old version (used internally by the a.out libraries):

             New                 Old

        /var/log/wtmp       /var/adm/wtmp
        /var/log/lastlog    /var/adm/lastlog
        /var/run/utmp       /var/adm/utmp

HIGHLIGHTS for version 2.2:
1) This is primarily a quick bug-fix release for version 2.1
2) mkfs wrapper added back in, since e2fsprogs only supplies an fsck wrapper
3) selection removed, since someone appears to be maintaining it now.  See
   sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/linux/kernel/patches/console for recent sources.
   For the time being, I'm keeping a copy in the historic subdirectory of
   util-linux.  A "make install" should work find from within that
   directory.
4) Note that other floppy utilities are available from:
    ftp.imag.fr:pub/Linux/ZLIBC/fdutils/fdutils-4.1.src.tar.gz
    sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/system/Misc/fdutils-4.1.src.tar.gz
    tsx-11.mit.edu:/pub/linux/sources/sbin/fdutils-4.1.src.tar.gz


HIGHLIGHTS for version 2.1:

1) Directory structure rearrange, with configuration support for those who
   use shadow passwords and System V init (no support is provided for these
   things, but your utilities won't get overwritten if you do a "make
   install" after you properly edit MCONFIG).
2) fdisk and cfdisk should work as expected with 2GB+ disk drives
3) As usual, lots of stuff was updated and added, including mount, vipw,
   readprofile
4) Some stuff was also deleted, and can now be found elsewhere:
    fsck wrapper: tsx-11.mit.edu:/pub/linux/ALPHA/ext2fs/e2fsprogs*
    pwd, su: prep.ai.mit.edu:/pub/gnu/sh-utils*
    ed: prep.ai.mit.edu:/pub/gnu/ed*

mount:
    mount, umount, swapon

    Rick Sladkey put together the mount-0.99.6.tar.Z package, and Stephen
    Tweedie provided updates.  The utilities were originally from that
    package (all appear to be by Doug Quale (quale@saavik.cs.wisc.edu),
    with modifications by H. J. Lu (hlu@eecs.wsu.edu) on 11/25/92; Rick
    Sladkey (jrs@world.std.com) in January 1993; and Stephen Tweedie
    <sct@dcs.ed.ac.uk> on 8 October 1993.  This distribution mount now
    supports NFS stuff.  I have modified the man pages.  I have also added
    a small patch from Hamish Glen Coleman (t933093@minyos.xx.rmit.OZ.AU)
    which restores the -o semantics.
    
    Updated with Rick Sladkey's mount-0.99.14.tar.gz package, and with
    extra patches from Rick.  Adam J. Richter allowed -t option to be
    optional. Patrick J. Volkerding (volkerdi@mhd1.moorhead.msus.edu) and
    Mitchum DSouza both provided patches that fixed the (null) problem when
    not using -t. Mitchum DSouza
    (mitch@mrc-applied-psychology.cambridge.ac.uk) added support for loop
    device mounts. Sebastian Lederer
    (lederer@next-pc.informatik.uni-bonn.de) added support for sending an
    unmount RPC call to the server when an NFS-filesystem is unmounted.
    Sander van Malssen (svm@kozmix.hacktic.nl) added support for remounting
    readonly file systems readonly.  Mike Grupenhoff
    <kashmir@umiacs.UMD.EDU> added a probe of the superblock for the type
    before /proc/filesystems is checked.  Andries.Brouwer@cwi.nl fixed up
    error reporting.

    Updated with patches from Andries.Brouwer@cwi.nl and Dan Quinlan
    (quinlan@yggdrasil.com).  And more patches from Andries and others.

historic/selection: The complete selection-1.5 package, by Andrew Haylett
    <ajh@gec-mrc.co.uk>, 17th June 1993, is included in the historic tree.
    Kernel patches are no longer necessary for modern kernels, but these
    were tiny so I left them in for historical reasons.  The Makefile was
    modified for this distribution.  With changes from Rick Sladkey.

               notes about this in the documentation. However, Theodore
               Ts'o (tytso@ATHENA.MIT.EDU) released version 2.10, and that
