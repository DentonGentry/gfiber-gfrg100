.SH NAME
swapon, swapoff \- enable/disable devices and files for paging and swapping
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /sbin/swapon [\-h \-V]
.br
.B /sbin/swapon \-a [\-v]
.br
.BI "/sbin/swapon [\-v] [\-p " "priority" "] " " specialfile " ...
.br
.B /sbin/swapon [\-s]
.br
.B /sbin/swapoff [\-h \-V]
.br
.B /sbin/swapoff \-a
.br
.BI /sbin/swapoff " specialfile " ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Swapon
is used to specify devices on which paging and swapping are to take place.
Calls to
.B swapon
normally occur in the system multi-user initialization file
.I /etc/rc
making all swap devices available, so that the paging and swapping activity
is interleaved across several devices and files.

Normally, the first form is used:
.TP
.B \-h
Provide help
.TP
.B \-V
Display version
.TP
.B \-s
Display swap usage summary by device.
This option is only available if
.I /proc/swaps
exists (probably not before kernel 2.1.25).
.TP
.B \-a
All devices marked as ``sw'' swap devices in
.I /etc/fstab
are made available.
.TP
.BI \-p " priority"
Specify priority for
.BR swapon .
This option is only available if
.B swapon
was compiled under and is used under a 1.3.2 or later kernel.
.I priority
is a value between 0 and 32767. See
.BR swapon (2)
for a full description of swap priorities. Add
.BI pri= value
to the option field of
.I /etc/fstab
for use with
.BR "swapon -a" .
.PP
.B Swapoff
disables swapping on the specified devices and files, or on all swap
entries in
.I /etc/fstab
when the
.B \-a
flag is given.
.SH NOTE
You should not use
.B swapon
on a file with holes.
Swap over NFS may not work.
